			<p>
				We have a drive to deliver exceptional attention to detail, courtesy, and pride in listing and working with your home. We know the excitement and trepidation of listing a home and drive to make others see what is special to you. Our negotiations are fueled by knowledge of the area and emerging property trends in this fast-paced market. Be it a residential home, vacation home, or your first attempts into the market, we have the tools to teach. We'll take your requirements to the market and all the way to your new front door.

				The Great Basin area is home to the snowy peaks of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, a wealth of recreational activities and family fun. Along the skyline, Downtown and Midtown Reno's burgeoning night life and corporate developments crest the ever-updating culture.

				We love the area, and we know you will too.

					Growing up, my family had a home in the Lake Tahoe area. It started a lifelong love affair with the area that continues to this day. From the snowy slopes of Tahoe to the vibrant, emerging communities in the valley, Reno has witnessed an incredible transformation. I am thrilled to be your guide to the area as we grow our community.

				<p>
					Real estate is an adaptive and challenging market, and it has been a wonderful avenue for meeting new people. From closing my first home to attaining my broker's license, my enthusiasm has only grown. The reward of seeing happy homeowners is self-evident, but I also understand that the intricacies of market knowledge coupled with deft negotiation are important factors in securing your portfolio goals. I hope I can lend my skills in your search.
